### Using Bootstap and its glyhicons -  create simple page with clickable Star icon.

#### Basic

- When hovering over the star, cursor should be changed to pointer, and icon should increase its size by 3%

#### Advanced
- Create account on **github**
- Create branch **exercise_1** in this repository (you need to be added as a contributor, by repo owner before that)
- Push your code to new created branch
- Create **PR** (*pull request*) to master branch with your changes.
